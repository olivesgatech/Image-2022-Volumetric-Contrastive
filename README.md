# Volumetric Supervised Contrastive Learning for Seismic Semantic Segmentation

## Usage
- Run code in main_supcon.py to perform supervised contrastive learning on volume and generate model file.
- Run code in main_seismic_semantic.py to do semantic segmentation on model file generated in first step.
